### Manual Install

2. Go to the Tampermonkey Dashboard (this can be accessed by clicking on the Tampermonkey icon in your toolbar and selecting "Dashboard" from the dropdown)
3. Go to the "Utilities" tab on the right

## Notes

When you first view a page where it will run (a page for a game) it will ask you if it can make a web request. This is simply getting a JSON file from [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) for the Linux compatibility. Always allowing it will make it run without issue.
